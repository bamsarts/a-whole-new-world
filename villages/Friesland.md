#Friesland

Friesland is a quaint little village but a rather queer place. Frieslanders are rather peculiar people whose lives are devoted to philosophical endeavors, but not merely endeavors, for Frieslanders,  philosophy is a way of life. By this I don't mean what is typically thought, there are no Buddhas sitting below trees, instead the country is littered with philosophical puzzles.

As you stroll down the country lane you will see large barns all around. Unfortunately, you can never be sure if these are truly barns you see or merely facades. Frieslanders raise barn facades on their properties as a way to pass time. As you continue along you are sure to marvel at our beautiful pastures. In one of them you may think you see a sheep. You continue down the road and find the shepherd and ask him "Are there sheep in that field?" He will answer yes, but unbeknownst to new-comers, Frieslanders always keep their sheep out of sight of the road and they always leave a sheep dog that looks remarkably like a sheep right by it. 

Of course, despite their peculiarities Frieslanders are very friendly people. You might meet Joe one day as you walk into town. He will certainly greet you and strike up a most pleasant conversation. Later that same day see him from afar, unfortunately you can never be sure if it is really Joe. You see, twins are rather common in Friesland and you never know who might have one.
